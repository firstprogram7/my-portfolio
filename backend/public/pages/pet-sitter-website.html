              The Pet Sitters Cape Town homepage was in need of some love, so I
              gave it a complete facelift.
            </p>

            <p>
              This case study highlights how the redesign aligns with best
              practices for modern pet-care websites:

            <p>
              With a few refinements especially around visuals,
              mobile-friendliness, and navigation simplification the website now
              better supports conversions, builds trust, and strengthens brand
              differentiation.

      <div class="text-xl space-y-6 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The Pet Sitters Cape Town website had not been refreshed in some time,
          and several known user challenges were starting to impact the customer
          experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal was to modernise the look and feel, clarify the service
          offering, and make it easier for pet owners to submit booking or
          service queries.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key constraint was that the existing backend needed to remain
          intact, so all improvements had to be achieved through front-end
          restructuring, UX enhancements, and visual design updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          When reviewing the previous version of the homepage, it became clear
          that the design attempted to place as much as possible above the fold
          likely due to older marketing assumptions.
        </p>

        <p>
          While it was impressive how much content was squeezed into the top
          section, it created a dense, cluttered layout with many competing
          elements. This made it difficult for new visitors to understand the
          services offered and how to book.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using insights from user behaviour and client feedback, we redesigned
          the homepage to guide visitors through a clearer narrative:
        </p>

        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">
          Who we are → What we do → Why we’re trusted → How to book.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SKETCH TO CODE -->
    <section class="max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 my-20 space-y-10">
      <h2 class="text-3xl text-center md:text-4xl font-semibold">
        From Sketch → Code
      </h2>

      <img
        src="/img/sketch1.jpg"
        alt="Website sketch"
        class="w-full rounded-lg shadow"
      />
      <div class="text-xl max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6">
        <p>
          When I dream up a new interface, I love starting with paper—sketching
          out each component, cutting them free, and arranging them on a bigger
          page with Blu-Tack. It feels a bit like building a joyful UI jigsaw
          puzzle(as seen in above sketch).
        </p>
        <p>
          This playful approach makes it easy to shift pieces around, explore
          new ideas, and refine parts of the design without redrawing everything
          from scratch. Once the page’s layout takes shape, we dive into more
          detailed, lively sketches of each module.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll go through the basic thought process behind each module design
          separately below.

        Case Study: Redesigning the Pet Sitters Cape Town Website

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Overview</h2>
        <div class="text-xl">
          <p>
            Pet Sitters Cape Town is an established home-based pet-care service
            with thousands of successful visits and a strong reputation in the
            Cape Town area. Although the business had grown significantly over
            the years, its website had not kept pace. As a result, several
            user-experience issues were beginning to impact customer
            understanding, trust clarity, and conversion rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            My objective was to modernise the website, improve how services were
            communicated, and create a simpler, more intuitive path for pet
            owners to make enquiries or bookings all while working within the
            constraints of the existing backend system.

      <div class="space-y-6 mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">01. Understanding the Problem</h2>
        <div class="text-xl">
          <p>
            Before the redesign, the homepage attempted to present nearly all
            information above the fold. This was likely driven by older
            marketing assumptions that users would not scroll, leading to a
            dense, visually heavy layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it was impressive how much content had been packed into one
            screen, this approach introduced several issues:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              The interface felt
              <strong>cluttered and visually overwhelming</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Users struggled to identify the
              <strong>primary call to action</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              The service offering was <strong>unclear at first glance</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Trust elements were present but
              <strong>not used strategically</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              New visitors found it difficult to understand
              <strong>how to book or what to expect</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Analytics, enquiry data, and customer feedback revealed that users
            needed a more structured and calming introduction something that
            built trust gradually instead of presenting everything at once.

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">
          1. Improve clarity of the service offering
        </h3>
        <div class="text-xl">
          <p>
            Pet owners should immediately understand who the business is, what
            services are provided, and how these services address real needs
            such as pet comfort, convenience, home safety, and affordability.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">2. Establish trust upfront</h3>
          <p>
            Certifications, years of experience, number of completed visits, and
            strong testimonials needed more strategic placement to support
            credibility.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">
            3. Increase conversions through a clearer booking flow
          </h3>
          <p>
            The “Book or Query” button required greater visibility, improved
            positioning, and a more supportive explanation of what users can
            expect after clicking.

      <div class="space-y-6 mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">03. The Approach</h2>
        <p class="text-xl">
          Because a backend rebuild was not in scope, improvements were achieved
          through thoughtful restructuring, UI enhancements, and visual updates
          on the front end.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Restructuring the narrative</h3>
        <p class="text-xl">
          Instead of overwhelming visitors with everything at once, the new
          design guides users along a logical path:
          <strong
            >Hero → Services → Benefits → Trust → Testimonials → Additional
            Offerings → Booking</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Clarifying the service offering</h3>
        <p class="text-xl">
          Service categories were reorganised into clear, scannable cards for
          daily visits, live-in care, home-care services, and specialised pet
          care. This helps users quickly identify what fits their needs.
        </p>

            class="ring-1 ring-gray-300"
          />
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Building trust earlier</h3>
        <p class="text-xl">
          Certification badges, experience metrics, and genuine testimonials
          were elevated higher on the page to better support first-time
          visitors.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Strengthening the CTA</h3>
        <img
          src="/img/booknow_clip.PNG"
          alt="book now button clip"
          class="w-full ring-1 ring-gray-100 rounded-md shadow"
        />
        <p class="text-xl">
          The primary call-to-action,<strong>“Book or Query Here,”</strong> was
          made more prominent and repeated throughout the page to support
          decision-making at every step.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/img/bokknow_clip2.PNG"
          alt="book now button clip 2"
          class=""

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
          Clearly communicate the company's core services
        </h2>
        <div class="text-xl space-y-4">
          <p>
            Since the business revolves around pet care, the content needed to
            feel warm, reliable, and highly organized, reassuring pet owners
            that their pets would be in safe hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I structured this section into four key service cards: Professional
            Pet Care, Complete Home Care, Flexible Service Options, and
            Specialised Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layout uses a balanced grid system supported by large, emotive
            pet images on top of each card. This creates immediate visual trust
            and helps users connect emotionally.
          </p>
          <p>Typography is used to establish clear hierarchy:</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="text-xl list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Service titles are bold and prominent.</li>
          <li>Descriptions are concise and easy to skim.</li>
          <li>
            Important notes (such as
            <strong><i>“FREE interviews”</i></strong> and
            <strong><i>“We do not require food/beverages”</i></strong> ) are
            highlighted in color for quick scanning.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-xl">
          A strong and visible <strong>“Book Now”</strong> button is placed
          centrally to encourage conversions, followed by a confidence-building
          reassurance statement:
          <strong><i>“Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.”</i></strong>

          This project shows how a thoughtfully redesigned front end can
          significantly improve user experience without altering backend
          systems. By reorganising information, highlighting trust elements, and
          guiding visitors through a clear narrative, the website now functions
          as a far more effective digital touchpoint helping both users and the
          business achieve better outcomes.

          The new design was put to the test against the original via an A/B
          experiment, and the results exceeded our expectations, showing
          superior performance in critical areas. Working within the tight
          technical scope presented a fun and valuable challenge. This project
          serves as a compelling case study on how even strictly visual
          modifications can dramatically improve the user experience and
          significantly boost a homepage's conversion rate.
