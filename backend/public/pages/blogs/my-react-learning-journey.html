              models, not because you are bad at programming.

            <li>
              Understanding core concepts like components, state, and props

            How I Finally Learned React After Initially Struggling Through Many
            Confusing Topics
          </h2>

          <p>
            Learning React was one of the most frustrating experiences of my
            developer journey—and also one of the most rewarding. When I first
            opened a React tutorial, I was confident. I already knew HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. How hard could a library be?
          </p>

          <p>As it turns out, very hard. Or at least, very confusing.</p>

          <p>
            Words like <strong>JSX</strong>, <strong>state</strong>,
            <strong>props</strong>, <strong>hooks</strong>,
            <strong>virtual DOM</strong>, and
            <strong>component lifecycle</strong> were thrown at me almost
            immediately. Tutorials jumped from simple examples to complex
            patterns without explaining <em>why</em> things worked the way they
            did. I felt lost, overwhelmed, and honestly questioned whether React
            was even for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            But eventually, something changed. React started making sense.
            Concepts clicked. The chaos became structure. In this post, I want
            to share exactly how I went from struggling and confused to
            confident and productive with React. If you're currently stuck where
            I once was, this story is for you.
          </p>

          <h2>The Initial Struggle: Why React Felt So Hard</h2>

          <p>
            The biggest mistake I made early on was assuming React was “just
            JavaScript with some extra syntax.” While React
            <em>uses</em> JavaScript, it requires a completely different way of
            thinking about user interfaces.
          </p>

          <p>
            Traditional JavaScript encourages you to manually manipulate the
            DOM. You select elements, update their content, and handle events
            directly. React, on the other hand, asks you to describe what the UI
            should look like based on state—and then trust React to handle the
            updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            This mental shift was not obvious to me at first. I kept asking
            questions like:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Why can't I just change the DOM directly?</li>
            <li>Why does my component re-render so often?</li>
            <li>Why does state update asynchronously?</li>
            <li>Why does everything feel so abstract?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Instead of slowing down to understand these ideas, I tried to push
            forward. I copied code from tutorials, watched videos at 1.5x speed,
            and hoped things would magically click. Spoiler: they didn't.
          </p>

          <h2>The Turning Point: Accepting That Confusion Is Normal</h2>

          <p>The turning point came when I stopped blaming myself.</p>

          <p>
            I realized that React is confusing for almost everyone at the
            beginning. It introduces abstractions that only make sense after
            you've used them for a while. Feeling lost didn't mean I was
            failing—it meant I was learning something genuinely new.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I accepted this, I changed my approach. Instead of trying to
            understand everything at once, I focused on mastering the
            fundamentals.
          </p>

          <h2>Focusing on the Core Concepts (And Ignoring the Noise)</h2>

          <p>
            One of the biggest breakthroughs was narrowing my focus. React has a
            massive ecosystem, but you don't need to learn all of it at once.
          </p>

          <p>I decided to focus on just a few core ideas:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              <strong>Components:</strong> Understanding that everything in
              React is a reusable component.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JSX:</strong> Learning how JSX translates to JavaScript
              and why it exists.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Props:</strong> Passing data down to components.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>State:</strong> Managing data that changes over time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Handling user interactions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I deliberately ignored advanced topics like Redux, context
            optimization, performance tricks, and complex hooks. This reduced my
            cognitive load and helped me build confidence.
          </p>

          <h2>Building Tiny Projects Instead of Watching Endless Tutorials</h2>

          <p>
            Another major shift was moving from passive learning to active
            building.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tutorials made sense while I watched them, but the moment I tried to
            write code on my own, my mind went blank. So I started building very
            small projects—projects so small they almost felt silly.
          </p>

          <p>Some examples included:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>A counter app with increment and decrement buttons</li>
            <li>A simple to-do list without any styling</li>
            <li>A form that captures user input and displays it</li>
            <li>A basic toggle switch using state</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These projects forced me to confront my misunderstandings. Every bug
            became a learning opportunity. Slowly, I stopped Googling every line
            of code and started reasoning through problems myself.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding State Changed Everything</h2>

          <p>
            State was the single most confusing concept for me—and also the most
            important.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I truly understood that state represents data that controls how
            a component renders, React suddenly made sense. Instead of thinking
            in terms of “changing the UI,” I started thinking in terms of
            “updating state.”
          </p>

          <p>This shift helped me understand:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Why components re-render</li>
            <li>Why state updates trigger UI changes</li>
            <li>Why React prefers immutability</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> felt
            much less magical once I understood the problems they were solving.
          </p>

          <h2>Revisiting Concepts (Again and Again)</h2>

          <p>
            One thing that surprised me was how often I had to relearn the same
            concepts. I didn't fully understand props the first time. Or the
            second. Or even the third.
          </p>

          <p>
            But each time I revisited them, my understanding deepened. React
            concepts layer on top of each other, and clarity comes gradually,
            not instantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of feeling frustrated, I learned to see repetition as
            progress.
          </p>

          <h2>The Moment React Finally Clicked</h2>

          <p>The “aha” moment didn't come all at once. It happened quietly.</p>

          <p>
            One day, I built a feature without needing a tutorial. I structured
            components naturally, managed state confidently, and debugged issues
            without panic.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's when I realized I had finally learned React. Not because I
            knew everything—but because I understood how to think in React.
          </p>

          <!-- Summary -->

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Learning React was not a straight path. It was messy, confusing, and
            full of self-doubt. But the struggle was not a sign of failure—it
            was part of the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            By focusing on core concepts, building small projects, embracing
            confusion, and revisiting ideas multiple times, I eventually
            developed a strong mental model of React.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're struggling with React right now, don't give up. Confusion
            is temporary, and clarity comes with patience and practice. One day,
            React will click for you too—and when it does, the journey will be
            worth it.
